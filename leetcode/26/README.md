#PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that element appears only one and return the new length.
Do no allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

#EXAMPLE:
Input : [1,1,2]
output : 2, nums [1,2]

#EXAMPLE 2:
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4]
